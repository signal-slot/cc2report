# cc2report Development Plan

## Current Status (Updated 2025-07-02)

The project has evolved from a basic log analyzer to a sophisticated AI-powered work report generator with significant enhancements:

### Completed Features
- ✅ **Core Functionality**
  - Transitioned from keyword-based to AI-only analysis
  - Multi-language support (19 languages)
  - Fixed duplicate category entries in reports
  - JSON output format implemented
  - Date range support implemented
  - CI/CD pipeline set up with GitHub Actions

- ✅ **Recent Enhancements (2025-07-02)**
  - Progress indication with visual feedback
  - Template customization via TOML files
  - API response caching (12x speedup)
  - Token usage tracking and cost estimation
  - Parallel API processing for faster analysis

## Phase 1: Remaining Critical Fixes (High Priority)

### 1.1 Fix Integration Tests
- **Issue**: Tests reference non-existent exports (`analyze_logs`, `generate_report`)
- **Solution**: Update tests to use current API or implement proper unit tests
- **Status**: Tests are currently broken
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours

### 1.2 Error Recovery and Partial Reports
- **Issue**: Single API failure stops entire report generation
- **Solution**: Continue processing other projects even if one fails
- **Status**: Not implemented (partial mitigation via caching)
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours

## Phase 2: Feature Enhancements (Medium Priority)

### 2.1 Report Aggregation
- **Status**: AI aggregates by project, but time-based summaries incomplete
- **Feature**: Enhance `--weekly`, `--monthly` flags for better aggregation
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours

### 2.2 Fallback for API Failures
- **Feature**: Local pattern-based analysis when OpenAI API is unavailable
- **Use case**: Offline usage, API outages, cost savings
- **Effort**: 4-5 hours

### 2.3 Advanced Cost Optimization
- **Feature**: Auto-select model based on project complexity
- **Current**: Manual model selection implemented
- **Enhancement**: Analyze project size/complexity to choose optimal model
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours

## Phase 3: Performance & Distribution

### 3.1 Publish to crates.io
- **Tasks**: 
  - Fix broken tests
  - Add comprehensive documentation
  - Create usage examples
  - Set up release automation
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours

### 3.2 Advanced Analytics
- **Features**:
  - Trend analysis over time
  - Productivity metrics
  - Project complexity scoring
- **Effort**: 5-6 hours

## Implementation Order

1. **Immediate**: Critical Fixes
   - Fix integration tests
   - Implement error recovery for partial failures

2. **Next Sprint**: Enhanced Features
   - Improve weekly/monthly aggregation
   - Add offline fallback mode
   - Auto model selection

3. **Future**: Distribution & Analytics
   - Publish to crates.io
   - Add advanced analytics features

## Success Metrics

- ✅ AI-powered analysis working in 19 languages
- ✅ No duplicate categories in reports
- ✅ Progress indication and user feedback
- ✅ Template customization support
- ✅ Cost-effective with caching
- ✅ Token usage transparency
- ✅ Parallel processing capability
- ⏳ Working test suite (currently broken)
- ⏳ Graceful API failure handling
- ⏳ Published on crates.io

## Technical Achievements

### Performance Improvements
- **Caching**: 12x speedup for repeated queries
- **Parallel Processing**: 15-40% time reduction for multi-project analysis
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into processing status

### Cost Management
- **Token Tracking**: Exact usage and cost per report
- **Model Selection**: Choose between GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and variants
- **Cache System**: Reduces API calls for unchanged projects

### User Experience
- **Template System**: Customizable prompts and report formats
- **Multi-language**: Native support for 19 languages
- **Flexible Output**: Markdown and JSON formats

## Future Considerations

- **Claude API Integration**: Direct integration for real-time analysis
- **Web Dashboard**: Browser-based report viewing
- **Export Formats**: CSV, Excel, PDF reports
- **Team Reports**: Aggregate reports across multiple users
- **Budget Management**: Spending limits and alerts
- **Local LLM Support**: Privacy-focused alternatives (Ollama, etc.)
- **Git Integration**: Automatic commit message generation from reports

## Lessons Learned

1. **AI-First Approach**: Moving from keyword matching to AI analysis dramatically improved report quality
2. **Caching is Critical**: API costs can add up quickly without proper caching
3. **User Feedback**: Progress indicators significantly improve user experience
4. **Flexibility**: Template system allows users to adapt the tool to their needs
5. **Performance**: Parallel processing is essential for multi-project environments
